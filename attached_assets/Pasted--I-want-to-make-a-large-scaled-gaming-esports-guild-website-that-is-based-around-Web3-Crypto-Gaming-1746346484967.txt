along with Flex and other materials need to craft and merge and what they should look for and save, 1 On 1 this will be a 1 on 1 help were if they cant understand what were saying for crafting and merging we will fully

all this i don't already have a way to receive payment so we will have to make a way to receive payments in debit/credit card form, & crypto.

- Noting for both courses page and rentals page make it so there is sections for each game not only Boss Fighters & if and when we add a new game to the games sections a new rental/course page is also created 

- Calculators Page: This is were we will have a variety of CWG/ClockWork Gamers exclusive calculators to were only verified CWG members can use it this will range from Earnings calculator were they can type in there BFTokens
they got in a single match along with how many minutes it took them in game to receive that and it will automatically tell them how much there making per minute and per hour but to do this we will have to input some numbers
so as of right now BFToken is going for $13.99 per 1000 tokens so if u do the math on that it mean per 1 token is 0.01399 for sponsor marks markets say $3.64 per 100 sponsor marks that mean every 1 sponsor mark goes for 
0.0364 now markets also say for 67330 flex it cost $500 that means for every 1 flex it will cost u 0.0074261102034754 per 1 flex and in regards to badge cost to recharge its Common 420 Flex 26 Sponsor Recharge Max 1 Hour,
Uncommon 590 Flex 37 Sponsor Recharge Max 2 Hours, Rare 1100 Flex 66 Sponsor Recharge Max 3 Hours, Epic 2800 Flex 171 Sponsor Recharge Max 4 Hours, Legendary 7100 Flex 442 Sponsor Recharge Max 5 Hours, Mythic 20400 Flex
1263 Sponsor Recharge Max 6 Hours now for crafting cost Common 1300 Flex Only No Sponsor Marks Needed, Uncommon requires 2 Common badges and 300 Flex 444 Sponsor Marks, Rare requires 2 Uncommon badges and 1200 Flex 790 Sponsor,
Epic requires 3 rare badges and 5400 Flex 2363 sponsor marks, Legendary requires 3 epic badges and 22300 flex 6946 sponsor, Mythic requires 3 legendary badges and 86700 flex 20507 sponsor, & lastly Exalted requires 
3 mythic badges and 326000 flex 62348 sponsor marks with this being all said we will have 1 calculator for earnings per hour which would be calculated by BFToken gained per match how many minutes divide that down to a minute
figure out the hourly BFToken gain figure out the pricing of how much BFToken that comes out to then take the cost of the specific rarity cost of the recharge minus that by the gain and then u get your total profit per hour
but with this too we have to make it so players can select 1-5 badges on the earning calculator so they can get there exact earnings with no earning included along with going on over to to badge crafting calculator we will be
able to figure out exactly how much money is needed to go from no badges to a specific tiered badge lets say legendary or select start at a rare badge but I'm aiming for a mythic badge it will tell me what is required total
amount of flex/sponsor marks needs what badges and how many are needed to get to were i need to along with how long it will take have either 1 or multiple showrunner contracts to the crafting calculator we will also be able
to fill out how many show runner contracts we have to calculate this along with what rarity it is because in order to make the specific tier badge u need that specific tiered showrunner contract along with there is also a 
time that each badge takes to recharge and takes to craft here's the numbers for that as well Common recharge time is 8 hours to obtain 1 hour & takes 48 hours to craft, Uncommon recharge time is 8 hours to obtain 1 hour & 
takes 72 hours to craft, Rare recharge time is 8 hours to obtain 1 hour & takes 96 hours to craft, Epic recharge time is 8 hours to obtain 1 hour & takes 120 hours to craft, Legendary recharge time is 8 hours to obtain 1 
hour & takes 144h hours to craft, Mythic recharge time is 8 hours to obtain 1 hour & takes 168 hours to craft, & lastly Exalted recharge time is 8 hours to obtain 1 hour & takes 192 hours to craft
